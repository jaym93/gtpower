    Send 'b_id' (building ID), 'tag' (Tag Name) in POST body to add to the database.
    Tags let users create searchable substrings associated with abbreviations, acronyms, aliases or sometimes even events inside a building. For example, Office of International Education is inside the Savant building, and Tags exists so there can be a mapping from "OIE" to "Savant building" so it appears in the search results.
